# SushiBits CANoPI

Isolated CAN or Raspberry Pi Zero

## Introduction & Goal

I have finally got around to take a jab at the CAN bus. This interface board
allows the CAN interface to be used by the Raspberry Pi Zero. It also provides
galvanic isolation for the CAN interface for added safety.

It also includes a real time clock for the Pi, as automated controllers often
calls for one.
